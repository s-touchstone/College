		Provides an introduction to  network  science.  Modeling  of  systems  as  networks,  using  graph  theory, from a variety of disciplines is explored. Analysis algorithms for networks and the challenges associated with applying them to large scale networks are presented. Related software for network analysis is studied. The course will focus on the applications of complex network analysis to fi elds such as biology, cyber-security, and social networks.
