alias cancel_print='cancel `lpstat -o |grep stetou|cut -d" " -f1`'

alias update='sudo apt-get update & sudo apt-get upgrade'

This alias would be useful for multiple scenarios. I have been in 
one situation before where I had to keep running these two commands
repeatedly because of repository issues. I would make an adjustment
and then try to run the updates again. This could be used to repeat
those actions without having to type in the longer versions repeatedly.
